## Level &LEVELNUMBER&: Introduction - Create a Home of Your Own

> Challenge: Find the password to **&NEXTLEVELTITLE&**

In this challenge, the executable, 'introtempdir' creates a file and writes the
password into it. You will need a place to write the file into so create one
for yourself in `/tmp/`.

Note: Even though the parent directory `/tmp/` is unlistable, you can still
create child directory and `cd` into it.
