# INSTRUCTIONS
## Level 00 - Getting to know the game

### TL;DR (too long; didn't read)
> Challenge: Find the password to level01

> Commands you may need
`cat`

The goal of each level is to find and reveal the password for the next level.
Each level presents a challenge which you need to solve to get to the next level.
Once you have the password, you can switch user to the next level, using `su level01`.

If you find you can side-step the challenge, great! You've hacked that level.*
You may use whatever it takes to get the password for the next level! ;)

### Docs
Each level contains a docs directory in `/home/levelXX/docs`.
In there, you'll find:
```sh
docs
├── hints
├── instructions
└── solution

0 directories, 3 files
```

#### hints
View the hints file.

#### solution
Give up. Reveal how its done. Get the password to the next level. `su` on up...
